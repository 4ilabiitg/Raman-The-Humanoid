## Overview

Project Raman is a powerful android robot being designed in the form of an adult human, with its body shape built to resemble the human body. Our objective is to explore and research the field of robotics to make facilitate robot interaction and cooperation with humans.

Historically, androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction. Only recently have advancements in robot technology allowed the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots. Theoretically, humanoids can perform any task a human being can, so long as they have the proper software. However, the complexity of doing so is immense. Hence we have a large team divided into sub-teams working on different problem statements, to come up with a humanoid that can perform numerous tasks.

## Specifications
- Detect and locate objects, faces, face recognition.
- Retrieve chatbot responses based on classification and clustering algorithms for pre-programmed questions and Artificial Intelligence will answer general questions.
- 3D Object Localization and tracking, Trajectory estimation.
- Hands that are capable of performing some simple tasks.
- 6 wheelbase for locomotion of Raman.
- Path planning, obstacle avoidance, understanding the surrounding environment.

## Milestones
**Head**
It can interact with humans in voice to voice format while maintaining the eye contact with the user. It can recognize the developers. The chatbot can perform small arithmetic calculations, memorizing, answers some general knowledge questions, etc. Version 1 of the head part is completed and it was demonstrated in TechEvince

**Hands and Chest**
This is our major concentration now. We need to design and develop the hands that are capable of performing some simple tasks like Poses and moves replication, interactive body language maintenance (Waving, Handshake, etc), picking up objects, throwing balls, aiming targets, etc

**Lower body**
We will have to build a 6 wheelbase with a dynamic structure inspired by stair climbing bot such that it can handle rough terrains.
